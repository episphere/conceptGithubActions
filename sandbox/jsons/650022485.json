  "Current Question Text": "Endometrial Biopsy. A healthcare provider used a plastic or metal instrument called a speculum to open your vagina, and inserted a very thin, flexible tube into your uterus. Then, using a suction, the provider took a small amount of tissue through the tube. The suctioning took about a minute or less and was likely done in your providerâ€™s office. The tissue is then looked at under a microscope to check for cancer or other problems.",
