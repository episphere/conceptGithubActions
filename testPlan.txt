Document How Existing Code Works

Existing Code:

- Reads Concept Ids one by one
- Concept ID's with [Deprecated, New or Revised] key with Deprecated value are NOT added to Transformation 

Note: Causing problems since some format/values are being used as Question Text (This is causing unwanted removals to Transformation)
