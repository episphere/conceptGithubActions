STEPS TO RESOLVE TRANSFORMATION STRUCTURE ğŸš€

*FIND FIRST DATE WHERE THIS OCCURRED* (2/15/2023)âœ…

*TAKE NOTE OF ALL THE MISSING RESPONSES OR VARIABLES* âœ…

*Take all 756774083 the concept Ids in Rows and try to get a concept Id without the deprecated block*

ABOUT THE DEPRECATED, NEW OR REVISED Column

Rules to follow for DD:

Only allow deprecate value for first row 
- if row with concept Id for current question text is the only one (no subsequent rows)
- if there are following rows and subsequent rows have no "revised" or "keep" values


Possiblity of excluding the Deprecated, New, or Revised fields from getting added to the actual conceptId#.json???



Create new function to remove any deprecated columns
Check for "deprecated" value and ignore the row or 

*DANGER*

(ConceptId to test -->  869829679.json)

Finding deprecated row as first column may work?

If current row is deprecated ignore the current row and conceptId.json from being updated or created

The subsequent row can take a similar approach where the row will be skipped

For now keep Columns "Deprecated, New or Revised columns

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Document How Existing Code Works

Existing Code:

- Reads Concept Ids one by one
- Concept ID's with [Deprecated, New or Revised] key with Deprecated value are NOT added to Transformation 

Note: Causing problems since some format/values are being used as Question Text (This is causing unwanted removals to Transformation)

New Method to Get Rid of Deprecated value --> Root Concept Id Level

--> Find location in the code that is pushing column names 
--> Get rid of deprecated columns from being added
