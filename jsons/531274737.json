  "Current Question Text": "Hysteroscopy. A healthcare provider inserted a thin, flexible tube through your vagina to look inside your uterus and check for cancer or other problems. It is likely that you were awake and may have had numbing medicine, but were able to drive yourself home. Your provider could also have given you a sedative to relax you, in which case someone else needed to drive you home.",
