This should be triggered by a combination of sending the Study IDs to the \"\"Get Participant Token\"\" API and then sending the deidentified demographic information to the \"\"Submit participant data\"\" API. Study IDs assigned a token/PIN, but who are not being actively recruited are flagged as zero (default) when the study ID is submitted. All individuals who sign-in without a valid token or pin are flagged as 2.",
