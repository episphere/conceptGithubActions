  "Dictionary": "Derivation is specific for baseline, follow-up derivations will be developed later. In lay language: eligible for baseline payment if all four baseline modules are submitted and a baseline clinical blood sample (any blood tube) is collected OR if all four baseline surveys are submitted and the participant has checked in for a research baseline visit. Else not eligible. Further derived response to be developed as further workflow is developed",
