  "Derivation Notes": "First checks if participant is still currently marked as NOT eligible. Sets true / false variables for each of the four modules based on if the status of the modules is completed, sets true / false variable for blood collected based on if baseline blood is yes or the KP variable for clinical site blood collected is yes. If these fives values are all true, the participant is eligible for the incentive. If the modules are all true but blood collected is false, we filter through all baseline research collections for that participant and if any of the tubes have a reason not collected equal to anything other than refused, the participant is eligible.",
