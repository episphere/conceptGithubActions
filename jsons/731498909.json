  "Derivation Notes": "Derivation is specific for baseline, follow-up derivations will be developed later. In lay language: eligible for baseline incentive if all four baseline modules are submitted and a baseline clinical blood sample (any blood tube) is collected OR if all four baseline modules are submitted and the participant has checked in for a research baseline visit.
