  "Derivation Notes": "Derivation of 173836415.266600170.740582332 in the baseline data update runs when clinical collections are finalized in the Biospecimen Dashboard. It is set equal to CID 915838974 BioReg_ArRegTime_v1r0 which is the time the collection is scanned into the Dashboard, if any clinical blood or urine tube is present when this process is run. It is set to prevent overwriting, meaning that if multiple collections are finalized for a participant, it will always reflect the collection scanned time for the first finalized collection.",
