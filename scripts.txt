rm -r ./jsons/[0-9]*.json
node runCSVConversions.js
node masterParsing.js 
node aggregateJSONS.js

Note: deprecated-new-revised-transformation-fix branch's masterParsing is used here. For context, this branch was used to handle removal of deprecated .jsons files from being created while preserving the csv that was being created. 
Now this can be done in one run instead of brnaching out.
